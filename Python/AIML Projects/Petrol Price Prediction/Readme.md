# Fuel Price Prediction and Vehicle Cost Analysis

A Python-based project for predicting future fuel prices in Indian metro cities and calculating total vehicle ownership costs based on these predictions.

## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to:
1. Predict future petrol and diesel prices
2. Calculate total cost of ownership for ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicles
3. Visualize price trends and forecasts

## Features

- Historical fuel price analysis for Indian metro cities
- 2-year price forecasting for both petrol and diesel
- Total cost of ownership calculation including:
  - Fuel costs based on predicted prices
  - Maintenance costs
  - Insurance costs
  - Other recurring costs
- Interactive visualizations of price trends

## Datasets Used
fuel_prices_metro_cities.csv -> Created with the data pdf from 2017 to 2024 got from the PPAC website
